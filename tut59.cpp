/*
C++ comes with libraries that provide us with many ways
for performing input and output. In C++ input and output
are performed in the form of a sequence of bytes or more
commonly known as streams.

Input Stream: If the direction of flow of bytes is from the 
device(for example, Keyboard) to the main memory then
this process is called input.

Output Stream: If the direction of flow of bytes is opposite
, i.e. from main memory to device( display screen ) 
then this process is called output.
