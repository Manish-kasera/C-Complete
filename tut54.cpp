/* Polymorphism --->Ek Chiz ka bahot Sare form
(One Name Multiple Form)
eg. Function overloading ,operator Overloading
eg. Virtual Overloading

Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. 
So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. 
This is called polymorphism.

/*
 ********* Polymorphism**********

 1. Compile Time polymorphism
     is acheived Using
       a.Function Overoading
         b.Operator Overloading

 2. Run-Time Polymorphism   
     is acheived Using
       a. Virtual function
